# OpenVDB

Native (autogenerated) Rust bindings for [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/).

For convenience the crate version tracks the tagged OpenVDB release it builds against. *Do not be misled by assuming this crate is any way mature because of the high version number.*

## Caveat

This crate *only supports macOS* at the moment. And even there the build fails. An [issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/issues/1768) has been logged with the bindgen developers.

## Prerequisites

When you clone the repository you should tell git to grab the submodules too:
```
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/virtualritz/openvdb-sys.git
```
If you already cloned the repository without this flag just do this:
```
> git submodule init
```

### Dependencies

Install dependencies for your platform. Scroll down to the resp. [section on the OpenVDB website](https://www.openvdb.org/documentation/doxygen/dependencies.html#depInstallingDependencies) and follow the instructions. Aka: copy/paste the listed commands and sit back.

## Building

No suprises here. The build may take a while as Cargo will build OpenVDB first, via CMake.

```
> cargo build
```
