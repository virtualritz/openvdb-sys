# OpenVDB

Native (autogenerated) Rust bindings for [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/).

For convenience the crate version tracks the tagged OpenVDB it builds against. *Do not be misled by assuming this crate is any way mature because of the high version number.*

## Caveat

This crate *only supports macOS* at the moment. And even there the build fails. An issue has been logged with the bindgen developers.

## Prerequisites

Install dependencies for your platform.

Scroll down to the resp. [section on the OpenVDB website](https://www.openvdb.org/documentation/doxygen/dependencies.html#depInstallingDependencies) and follow the instructions. Aka: copy/paste the listed commands and sit back.

## Building

No suprises here.

```
> cargo build
```
